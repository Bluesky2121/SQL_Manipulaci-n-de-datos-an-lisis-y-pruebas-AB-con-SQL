Quiz 01
Based on the dataset for this course, what does this query count?
 SELECT
     COUNT(*)
 FROM
     dsv1069.users
 JOIN
     dsv1069.orders
 ON
     users.id = orders.user_id
Counts the number of users
Counts the number of invoices
Counts the number of users who have ordered an item
Counts the number of rows in orders table
Assume you have no information about the data in the example table. When I run the query below, no rows are returned, but there are no error messages. What are possible reasons for this? (Select all that apply.)
 SELECT *
 FROM example_table
 WHERE id IS NULL
There are no rows in the example_table - it’s empty
There is no column called id
There are no rows with a null id
In the events table, (dsv1069.events) for this class, how many rows exist per event_id?
Always more than one
Exactly one
One per parameter_name
When you encounter a new dataset, which of the following can you assume? (Select all that apply.)
The data is out-of-date
The table has a primary key
Test usage is unfiltered
The table is empty
There are duplicate rows
TROUBLESHOOT THIS ERROR: Based on your exploration of the tables in the course dataset. Why are the results to this specific query empty?
 SELECT *
 FROM
     dsv1069.users
 JOIN
     dsv1069.events
 ON
     users.parent_user_id = events.user_id
 WHERE
     event_name = 'view_item'
 AND
     merged_at is NULL
The users table is empty
There are no events with this event_name
There are no parent_user_ids that satisfy the WHERE clause
TROUBLESHOOT THIS ERROR: Why are the results for this specific query empty?
 SELECT *
 FROM
     dsv1069.events
 WHERE
     event_name = 'item_view'
There are no events with this event_name
The table is empty
No items have ever been viewed
What does this query do? Select all true statements.
 SELECT
     COUNT(*)
 FROM
     dsv1069.events
 WHERE
     event_name = 'view_item'
The query counts the number of rows in the events table.
The query counts the number of rows corresponding to view_item events.
The query returns all of the rows in the events table.
The query counts the number of view_item events.
The query counts the number of events.
Consider the following query: What happens when some rows have a NULL value in the column table_alpha.key?
 SELECT *
 FROM table_alpha
 JOIN table_beta
 ON table_alpha.key = table_beta.column
Those values aren’t included in the result.
Each row with a null value will be joined to every row in table_beta.
Each row with a null value is joined to every row in table_beta where table_beta.column is null.
It is not possible for a join key to be null, the query will return an error.
Which of the following are problems with the query below?
 SELECT
     COUNT(*)
 FROM
     dsv1069.users
 JOIN
     dsv1069.orders
 ON
     users.parent_user_id = orders.user_id
Count(*) counts rows not unique users
We need a GROUP BY clause
We are missing a comma
The join should be on users.parent_user_id
There are no error messages, so it must be right
The join should be on users.user_id
In the users table, the column parent_user_id is ?.
Sometimes NULL
Never NULL
Always NULL
